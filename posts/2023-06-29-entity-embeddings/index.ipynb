    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the buzz around generative AI, most applications in industry still originate from tabular datasets. In tabular data, some columns may represent numerical variables, like *atmospheric pressure*, while others may be categorical variables, like *sex* or *product categories*. These can take only a limited number of values. The path to using numerical variables is relatively smooth and requires little preprocessing (for some algorithms, even none at all). In contrast, categorical variables must first be converted into numbers, as this is what a computer can process, and this can be done in many ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two conventional approaches to encode categorical variables are **ordinal encoding** and **one-hot encoding**. Ordinal encoding assigns each unique value to a different integer and, as such, assumes an ordering of the categories. For instance, \"Size\" could be the name of a categorical columns with values: *small* < *medium* < *large*, which would be mapped to 0, 1, and 2, respectively. One-hot encoding creates instead a new column for each possible value in the original data indicating its presence or absence. If the first sample in the dataset were *large*, we would get the following one-hot representation: (0, 0, 1). Unlike ordinal encoding, one-hot encoding does not assume an ordering of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, both ordinal and one-hot encodings have their limitations. To name a few, in ordinal encoding, the assigned numerical values may introduce unintended relationships or orders between categories that do *not* exist in the original data. One-hot encoding, while solving the issue of introducing unintended order, can lead to high-dimensional and sparse representations for features with a large number of unique categories. This translates into increased computational complexity and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, the [Rossmann sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) took place on Kaggle. The solution of one of the gold medal winners clearly diverged from the others by using a deep learning model, in one of the first known examples of a cutting-edge deep learning model for tabular data. Rather than using traditional encoding methods, the authors introduced the concept of **Entity Embeddings**. Entity Embeddings provide a way to represent categorical variables as *low-dimensional continuous* vectors, capturing the underlying semantic relationships between categories. This approach eliminates the limitations of ordinal encoding's introduced order and one-hot encoding's curse of dimensionality. Their approach is summarised in the paper [Entity Embeddings of Categorical Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06737), by Cheng Guo and Felix Berkhahn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore here the concepts and advantages of Entity Embeddings, diving deep and trying to replicate the main findings of the paper. Along the way, we'll offer a comprehensive understanding of their applications in general machine learning models."

    "Embeddings are at the heart of many recommender systems, particularly in cases where the possibility of employing a content-based approach is ruled out due to the lack of information about users and items. Collaborative filtering offers a (somewhat surprising) solution for predicting user preferences based only on the interests of other users.\n",
    "The key idea here is that of **latent dimensions**, which are features that describe users and items and are *automatically* discovered by a model. The resulting matrices containing the latent factors of users and items are exactly the user and item embedding matrices. Typically, they are determined via *low-rank matrix factorisation* or randomly initialised and improved during the *training of a neural network*.\n",

    "The entity embeddings we discuss today generalise this same idea to any categorical variable, i.e. we want to learn a low-dimensional vector representation for each category in a given categorical feature. We'll optimise these embeddings during the training process along with the rest of the model's parameters. The underlying intuition is that by representing categories as continuous vectors, the model can learn meaningful relationships and similarities between categories through their proximity in the embedding space. This allows the model to capture complex interactions and dependencies among categorical variables, which can be very valuable for predictive tasks."

    "\n",
    "Similarly to word embeddings in NLP (e.g. word2vec or GloVe), entity embeddings offer a low-dimensional, continuous representation of categorical variables that captures their semantic relationships. We have seen that, although they are derived from the training of a neural network, entity embeddings can also be used by non-deep learning models, such as random forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we discussed in detail how to construct embeddings and use them as features for an ensemble of decision trees. Along the way, we were able to reproduce part of the results contained in the paper of Guo and Berkhahn. In particular, replacing the ordinal encoded features in our random forests model with entity embeddings resulted in halving the error on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To wrap up, when should you give them a try? They are especially useful for datasets with features that have very high cardinality, where other methods often tend to overfit. Is the art of feature engineering dead? Certainly not. In particular, if you have domain knowledge, it would be a shame not to give it to your model via well-designed features."
